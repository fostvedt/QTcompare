This is an R Markdown document. This document will compare several different approached for modeling QT prolongation using simulated data. The models will be 


1. one
2. two
3. three


```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
