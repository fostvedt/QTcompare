This is an R Markdown document. This document will compare several different approached for modeling QT prolongation using simulated data. For all the models, the corrected QT interval (QTc) will be the resposne variable. This is calculated using the raw QT and RR intervals
$$
QTc = \frac{QT}{RR^\alpha}
$$
where $\alpha$ is the correction factor. Some standard correction factors are
fredericia correction is 0.33 whi (usually between .33 and .5).

> 1. Fredericia: $\alpha=1/3$
> 2. Bazett: $\alpha=1/2$


```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
