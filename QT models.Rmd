### Introduction 
This is an R Markdown document. This document will compare several different approached for modeling QT prolongation using simulated data. For all the models, the corrected QT interval (QTc) will be the resposne variable. This is calculated using the raw QT and RR intervals
$$
QTc = \frac{QT}{RR^\alpha}
$$
where $\alpha$ is the correction factor. Some standard correction factors are
fredericia correction is 0.33 (usually between .33 and .5).

> 1. Fredericia: $\alpha=1/3$
> 2. Bazett: $\alpha=1/2$
> 3. Study-Specific: Estimated -- usually between 1/3 and 1/2

The study specific correction factor $\alpha$ is estimates using a linear mixed effects model. The correction factor should be estimated using baseline ECG values. If triplicate ECGs were collected, then all the triplicate values should be included along with a random effect to account for this additional source of variability.

$$
\log(QT) = \log(QTc) + \alpha * \log(RR)
$$ 

Since the QTc value is unknown, it will be estimated by the intercept term in the model. This value represents the mean baseline QTc value. The estimate of $\alpha$ will be the "study-specific" fixed correction factor and is used to calculate all QTc measurements from the raw QT and RR measurements.   

This paper will evaluate three different scenarios, all of which assume there is a QTc prolongation effect from the drug concentration.

> 2. An RR-concentration effect with a fixed correction factor
> 3. An RR concentration effect where the correction factor is affected by the concentration

### No RR-Concentration Effect

In the case that the drug concentration does not affect the RR interval, then we can use the standard single correction factor to standardize the QT interval measurements for the heart rate effect -- A smaller RR interval results in a smaller QT interval -- to QT corrected values. Assuming there are no covariate effects on the corrected QT interval, the following linear mixed-effects model can be used to model the QTc-concentration relationship.

$$
QTc = (\beta_0 +\eta_{1i}) + (\beta_1 + \eta_{2i}) * conc + \epsilon_{ij} 
$$

$\beta_0$ represents the overall mean QTc interval length at baseline. $\beta_1$ represents the change in the QTc interval caused by the drug concentrations. $\eta_{1i}$ and $\eta_{2i}$ are random effects that are distributed multivariate normal with mean 0 and variance $\Sigma$. 







### RR-concentration effect with fixed correction factor

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
QTc & = & \frac{QT}{(RR+\gamma*conc)^\alpha}
\end{eqnarray}
$$

This model still assumes there is a single fixed correction factor that will work regardless of the concentration effect on the RR interval. 

### An RR concentration effect where the correction factor is affected by the concentration

Since the RR interval is being affected by the drug concentration, it is also possible that the correction factor is also being affected by the concentration. 

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
  QTc & = &\frac{QT}{(RR+\beta*conc)^\alpha} \\
  \alpha & = & a_0 + a_1 * conc
\end{eqnarray}
$$
